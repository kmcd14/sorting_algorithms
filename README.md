# Conceptual Thinking with Algorithms Project - Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains all files, scripts and documentation for a benchmarking application which finds the average time complexity of 5 sorting algorithms.  (conceptual thinkning with algorithms project)

## Project Brief

- Write a Python application which will be used to benchmark five different sorting algorithms.
- Write a report which introduces the algorithms you have chosen and discusses the results of the benchmarking process.
- The five sorting algorithms must be chosen by the following criteria:
  - A simple comparison-based sort (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort or Insertion Sort).
  - An efficient comparison-based sort (Merge Sort, Quicksort or Heap Sort).
  - A non-comparison sort (Counting Sort, Bucket Sort or Radix Sort).
  - Any other sorting algorithm of your choice.
  - Any other sorting algorithm of your choice.
